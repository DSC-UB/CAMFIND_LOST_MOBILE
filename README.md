PROCESS DOCUMENTATION
PROJECT PLANS
Time Schedule (Estimation)
The project has to be completed in a period of two months, that is eight weeks. 
During these eight weeks, meetings shall be held to determine and decide on the progression of the project. A meeting shall be held each week, that is eight meetings to the completion of the project.
PROJECT BUDGET
The main requirement for this project is data, since almost every part of the work will be carried online.
Talking of which, all the resources for the languages and software will be provided individually by the team members for the moment. Data too will be provided by the team for the moment too.
PROJECT QUALITY SYSTEM


Project Strategy
The main developing strategy is to use easy but complete developing languages. We create to suit the users. In this option, a survey has been carried to determine the users’ needs and desires. Some questions asked during the survey are:
•	Have you ever lost anything carrying your name and or phone number?
•	Have you ever found anything belonging to somebody you don’t know?
•	Are you aware of any reliable means that exist to recover lost items in Cameroon?
•	What do you think of a solution that could help the population with this problem?
•	Will you like to be charged for their services?
•	If yes, what is the least amount of money you are ready to pay for any missing item of yours?
•	What are your expectations for such a solution?
The marketing strategy has not been decided yet by executive members.
Operative Processes Used in the Project
The website solution shall be provided via web development technologies. The mobile solution shall be via application development tools.
The software to be used are:
•	User Interface (UI): Figma and Adobe XD
•	Version Control System: GitHub
•	IDE: JetBrains Suit
•	Hosting: Free PHP hosting
•	Communication: WhatsApp
•	Documentation: GitHub Wiki and Google docs
Module specifications:
•	Website development - Front end
	HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript
•	Website development – Back end
	PHP7 and MySQL (database)
•	Server 
	Wamp stack (since we shall be working on windows OS)
•	Mobile application development 
	Java for Android, Firebase (database)
RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
The principal risk of this project is the potential decrease in demand due to the fluctuating state of mind of the population, for every human being can desire something and the next second feel completely disinterested in it.
We are granted the opportunity to supply a solution that may not exist yet to a problem aged of several years. Hence the market to which it points is the group of all people in our locality, be it youth or old, victim to this snag.
PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION
PROJECT BUSINESS DIRECTION
Project Goal
To create a website and a mobile application in two months.
Project Purpose
To provide modern but easy-to-use solution that will help anybody find a lost item.
PROJECT SCOPE DESCRIPTION


Project Outcome
•	Problem Statement
Missing documents and items in Cameroon have been a big problem for many years ago. The frustrated moment in life is when a valuable document or item of yours is missing and you can’t find it. Especially in the case of documents, the procedure to establish a new one is very complicated and time consuming, which equally involves finances.
•	Solution Designed
A website and mobile application will be a perfect solution to this problem. There should be possibilities where, any individual who finds a lost item or document will be able to upload details about the lost item or document to this website or mobile app database. Also, interface should be provided where those who have lost their items will be able to search on the website or mobile app, and if their document has been identified, information should be displayed about the location of the document.

PROJECT ORGANISATION

Project Organisation, Roles, Responsibilities and Authority
Roles and Responsibilities
Most of the people that will be working on our project are the CAMFind_Lost members, the DSC community members but also our local community (that is who ever want to contribute).  We do this because our CAMFind_Lost project is an open source project and we aimed at not only helping the Cameroon CAMFind_Lost members but also developers (mostly from our Buea local community) gain the basic skills in open source. 
Product owner: Our project is an open source project, so whomever can have access to the source code but the project belongs to the DSC developer clubs.
Team member: We have members, main members. Our main members are those who contribute actively to the CAMFind_Lost project and belong to our DSC community.

Stakeholders: Our only stake holders is Google since they sponsor DSC University of Buea and help us have the basic necessities we will need in our projects. The basic necessities we need to develop this project are as follows.
Requirement from stakeholder
Amount
Reason

Internet connection of at least 30GB for period of 3 weeks 
10000FCFA
Most of developers will work remotely since we shall be using github.com as a platform for developing our CAMFind_Lost mobile app, so each of them will have their personal internet connection but we shall need internet connection for the meet-ups we have trice per week and most importantly for uploading past question and solutions to the firebase cloud.

Firebase storage of at least 25GB
 
We plan on creating a Google mail and using it free 15GB for our firebase storage to save the document but without doubt, 15GB be sufficient for a won’t be sufficient for a first release of the app since each user can add his own past question or solution to cloud.

Guide and Assistance

We shall need guide and assistance from Google since none of us student is an expert and are sure to encounter difficulties in the process of development of the application


Reporting and Communication Principles
Apart from physical meetings, the main communication means between the project team members is WhatsApp. Reason being that everybody is familiar with the software and it is easy to use.
Resources and Competence Plans and Profiles
The fundamental competence required for the accomplishment of our goal is core knowledge in development technology tools. In this effect, the resources (human and training resources) shall be provided by the DSC community alongside with the training.
